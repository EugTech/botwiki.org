Twitter bot maker and enthusiast [Bradley Momberger](https://twitter.com/air_hadoken) is taking beginners through the basics of doing amazing automated art and literature through Twitter, without the hard programming or tedious hosting setup.

Using Twitter and freely available tools, attendees will set up their own accounts and have three bots up and running by the workshop's end.
