Botwiki's *Bot Workshops* are envisioned as a series of events (mostly online, possibly also offline) for botmakers of all levels of technical expertise: artists, tinkerers, enthusiasts, seasoned pros.

Join our first botmaking workshop [Botmaking from the Ground Up](/bot-workshops/botmaking-from-the-ground-up/), hosted by [Bradley Momberger](https://twitter.com/air_hadoken), and follow [@botwikidotorg](https://twitter.com/botwikidotorg) for updates on future events!
