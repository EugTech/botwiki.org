Some examples of such bots include:

- [a reminder bot](bots/twitterbots/mnemosynetron)
- [a poker game bot](bots/slackbots/slack-poker-bot)
- [a bot that lets you catch Pokemon](/bots/slackbots/slack-pokemon)
- [a bot that opens the door for you](bots/slackbots/doorbell-server)
- [a bot that tweets every time your dog barks](bots/twitterbots/OliverBarkBark)

There are many more bots [on the **Bots** page](bots/) (you can jump directly to bots organized [ by **categories**](/bots/#browse-bots-by-categories) or [the **network**](/bots/#browse-bots-by-network) on which they operate) and you can use [this handy form](https://botwiki.org/submit-your-bot) to suggest a bot we should add.

We have an online group for [#botmakers](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23botmakers) and bot enthusiasts at [**botmakers.org**](https://botmakers.org/) and a weekly newsletter you can subscribe to at [**botzine.org**](http://botzine.org/). And be sure to check out our [Monthly Bot Challenge](/monthly-bot-challenge/)!
