Hi!

**Botwiki.org** is an [open-source](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org) collection of [tutorials](tutorials/), [articles](articles/), [datasets and other resources](resources/) for creating **useful, interesting, artistic and friendly** [online bots](bots/) -- *smart software agents that do fun or useful stuff* -- for [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [Slack](https://slack.com/), [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) and other online networks.

Some examples of such bots include:

- [a reminder bot](bots/twitterbots/mnemosynetron)
- [a poker game bot](bots/slackbots/slack-poker-bot)
- [a bot that lets your order ice cream](bots/slackbots/large)
- [a bot that posts current holidays](bots/twitterbots/holidaybot4000)
- [a bot that opens the door for you](bots/slackbots/doorbell-server)
- [a bot that tweets every time your dog barks](bots/twitterbots/OliverBarkBark)

You can see more bots [on the **Bots** page](bots/) (you can jump directly to bots organized [ by **categories**](/bots/#browse-bots-by-categories) or [the **network**](/bots/#browse-bots-by-network) on which they operate).

Do you want us to **include a friendly bot that you made or really like in our collection**? Send us a [pull request](https://github.com/botwiki.org) or use [this handy form](https://botwiki.org/submit-your-bot)!

Lastly, we'd love you to join fellow [#botmakers](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23botmakers) and bot enthusiasts over at [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/). Or you can go ahead and [check out the **Tutorials** section](tutorials/) to learn how to make your own online bot!
