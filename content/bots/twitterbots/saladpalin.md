[@saladpalin](http://www.twitter.com/saladpalin) is a Twitter bot created by [Evan Goldman](https://twitter.com/Www.twitter.com/twerribletweets). 

It rehashes [Sarah Palin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin)'s [Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump) presidential endorsement using Markov chains. Makes about as much sense as her actual speech.
