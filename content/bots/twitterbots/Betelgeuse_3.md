[@Betelgeuse_3](https://twitter.com/Betelgeuse_3) was a Twitter bot based on the "obnoxious, devious ghost named Betelgeuse" from the 1988 movie [Beetlejuice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetlejuice).

The bot would respond to tweets that contain the word "Beetlejuice" three times, similarly to how the ghost is summoned in the movie.

It was [permanently disabled](https://twitter.com/muffinista/status/641039127387967488) some time in July/August 2015 after Twitter blocked it.
