> Existing in the form of dedicated hardware (modern [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org), 1960's tubes) as well as bespoke software, it provides short movies or pictures of submitted words displayed on vintage neon tubes.

>It can also provide oracular answers to dilemmas in the form of an oblique strategy or an "eight ball" reply. Another function is providing short movies of all naughty (or nice) words recently used on twitter for inspiration or edification. It responds to the right trigger hashtags in any tweet, those @mentioned in the command are also @mentioned in the replies.

> When it's not answering bot requests it acts as a clock and realtime window onto twitter chatter in the author's workshop. new abilities are being added steadily.
