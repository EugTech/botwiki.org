[@omg_movies](https://twitter.com/omg_movies) is a Twitter bot created by [Javier Arce](https://twitter.com/javier). 

A bot that loves films big time but doesn't have a very good memory.

It randomly tweets movie titles and actor names with mistakes in them, for example: "I loved Ron Howard's A Beautiful Bind!", "Movie night with Back to the Suture", etc.
