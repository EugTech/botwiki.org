[@tauntbot](https://twitter.com/tauntbot) is a Twitter bot created by [@breefy](https://twitter.com/breefy). 

Tauntbot is a conversation bot which verbosely insults people who converse with it. It was inspired by [Monty Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python)'s "Argument" and "French Taunter" sketches. It has managed to fool a few people who don't realize it's a bot. Its English is excruciatingly correct most of the time. It can be incredibly rude but it tries not to be racist, sexist or homophobic.

It also blurts out random insults every couple of hours. It can get political with these. Some of its posts will be paired with captioned cat photos which the bot generates with its own code. 

There's an article about the bot on [fusion.net](http://fusion.net/story/208920/tauntbot-twitter-bot-insults-you/).
