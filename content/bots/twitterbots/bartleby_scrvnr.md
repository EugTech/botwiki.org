[@bartleby_scrvnr](https://twitter.com/bartleby_scrvnr) is a Twitter bot based on Bartleby, the main character from [Bartleby, the Scrivener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartleby,_the_Scrivener), a short story by Herman Melville. It only uses actual lines from the book, as opposed to being just an incomprehensible Markov chain bot.

It was created by [@fourtonfish](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish).
