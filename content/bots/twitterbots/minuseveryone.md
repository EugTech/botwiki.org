[@minuseveryone](https://twitter.com/minuseveryone) is a Twitter bot created by [@revdancatt](https://twitter.com/revdancatt) ([revdancatt.com](http://revdancatt.com)).

This bot, which also posts on [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/) at [minuseveryone.tumblr.com](http://minuseveryone.tumblr.com/), was a quick experiment in automated cartoon creation based on [Garfield minus Garfield](http://garfieldminusgarfield.net/) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield_Minus_Garfield)), but minus everyone instead.
