[@one_small_bot](https://twitter.com/one_small_bot) is an [open source](https://github.com/emmawinston/one_small_bot) Twitter bot created by [Emma Winston](https://twitter.com/deer_ful) that selects random words and tweets them in the context of [Neil Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong)'s [most famous quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Frase_de_Neil_Armstrong.ogg). _One small step for bot, one giant leap for botkind._

Author notes:

> I'd ultimately like this to work through the list sequentially like @everyword, but can't get this working in Heroku, I think due to their ephemeral file storage. If anyone has any suggestions on alternatives, please get in touch!

The [source code](https://github.com/emmawinston/one_small_bot) may also be useful as a basic template for a bot to tweet random lines from a text file.
