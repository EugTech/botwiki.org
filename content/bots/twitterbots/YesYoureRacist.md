[@YesYoureRacist](https://twitter.com/YesYoureRacist) is a Twitter bot that retweets tweets containing _"I'm not a racist"_. It turns out that many of these are actually quite racist. The bot was created by [](https://twitter.com/Logan Smith).

In the author's [own words](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/yes-youre-racist-the-casual-comments-permeating-twitter-8437127.html):

> Of course, anyone who followed the race-baiting campaigns of 2010 and 2012 knows that this rose-tinted look at American politics and culture couldn’t be further from reality. That’s why, at the height of President Obama’s reelection campaign this fall, I created the Twitter account @YesYoureRacist to disabuse people of the myth of a post-racial society one tweet at a time.

>For the past three months, I’ve been searching for tweets that begin “I’m not racist, but...”, and the results aren’t pretty. More often than not, the person goes on to say (without any trace of irony) something apparently racist – or at least, that’s what it looks like to me - as if the “not racist” disclaimer somehow excuses whatever they’re about to say.
