[@censusAmericans](https://twitter.com/censusAmericans) is a

<blockquote>
  [...] Twitter bot that mines for details in the [Census] data. [...] it tweets short biographies of Americans based on data they provided to the U.S. Census Bureau between 2009 and 2013. Using a small Python program, the bot reconstitutes numbers and codes from the data into mini-narratives. Once an hour, it turns a row of data into a real person.
