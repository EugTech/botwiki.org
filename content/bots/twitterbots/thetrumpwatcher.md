[@thetrumpwatcher](https://twitter.com/thetrumpwatcher) is a Twitter bot created by [@erocdrahs](https://twitter.com/erocdrahs) that lets its followers know how [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump) is feeling.

From author's blog:

> This bot parses Donaldâ€™s tweets, and performs a sentiment analysis to find out his mood. Generally speaking, this form of analysis is best used for larger volumes of text, and tends to be a bit hit and miss on a 140 character tweet. However, Mr Trump uses English at the level of an eleven year old child, which makes things easier.
