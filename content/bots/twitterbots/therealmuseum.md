[@therealmuseum](https://twitter.com/therealmuseum) is a Twitter bot created by Jessie Raymond and [Marissa Villeneuve](https://twitter.com/marissaville):

> The Real Museum [...] takes information from the economic reports and sponsor lists of major museums and packages them to look like artwork acquisition information.  It is the shell of the museum, void of all the actual content.
