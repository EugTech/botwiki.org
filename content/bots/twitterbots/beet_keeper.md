[@beet_keeper](https://twitter.com/beet_keeper) is an [open source](https://github.com/exponential-decay/binary-numbers) Twitter bot created by [Ross Spencer](https://twitter.com/beet_keeper). 

Using public domain color palettes made available by The National Library of New Zealand I create a new Twitter avatar each day my @beet_keeper account. The images are visual representations of the binary value for the day's number within the month. Documented here: http://exponentialdecay.co.uk/blog/not-quite-perfect-a-lil-automatic-twitter-thingy/ the project completed a 365 day run to allow me to make a year of 'gifs', also documented here: http://exponentialdecay.co.uk/blog/2015-a-year-in-binary/
