[@liketocontinue](https://twitter.com/liketocontinue) is a Twitter bot created by [Matt Webb](https://twitter.com/genmon). 

> **Like to Continue** is a short poem. The bot tweets the poem line by line, and the reader has to like each tweet to receive the next one. An experiment in a different form of interaction of Twitter, and what waiting for a response to a like feels like.
