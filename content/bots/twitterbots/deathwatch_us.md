[deathwatch.io](http://deathwatch.io) is a project created by [Caspar von Wrede](https://twitter.com/wrede) consisting of a website and several Twitter bots ([@deathwatch_us](https://twitter.com/deathwatch_us), [@deathwatch_de](https://twitter.com/deathwatch_de)).

The aim of the project is to "expose dead start-ups".

> [...] Caspar Wrede doesn’t think we should so easily forget the startups of Silicon Valley yesteryear. So the Berlin-based product manager built a Twitter bot called Deathwatch that monitors the health of tech start-ups. Companies that haven’t tweeted for 40 days are declared “unwell.” Those that have been inactive for 180 days or more are officially pronounced dead.
