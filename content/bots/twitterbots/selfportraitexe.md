[@selfportraitexe](https://twitter.com/selfportraitexe) is a Twitter bot created by [Ashur Cabrera](https://twitter.com/ashur) that generates "self-portraits based on its own always-growing [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) history".

From author's [blog post](http://cabreramade.co/selfportraitexe/):

> selfportrait.exe uses pieces of its current Git commit hash to select a "paint" color and determine where to paint. Based on a heavy-handed prescription of rules (written by a human (this one in particular)), the bot draws a chunky-pixel representation of its own codebase at that moment in time while also incorporating vestiges of its previous portraits.
>
> Each new change is committed to the repository history, producing a new commit hash. This, as you might guess, sets our bot-friend up to produce yet another portrait, ad infinitum. (Or until DigitalOcean goes out of business. Heyo.)
