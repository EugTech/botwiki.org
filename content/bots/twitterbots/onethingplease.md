[@onethingplease](https://twitter.com/onethingplease) is a Twitter bot created by [@vasilis](https://twitter.com/vasilis) that will *send you a thing if you ask me politely*.

> A few of you will try it out. And ask it to send you an image of beer. Or wine. Or a book. Or a computer. Or a lion. Or an alien. But most of the time this bot will be idling. In order to prevent it from getting too bored I gave it the power to update its profile pictures if nobody has asked it anything in the last 30 minutes.
