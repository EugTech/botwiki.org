[@ItIsYourData](https://twitter.com/ItIsYourData) is an [open source](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/source/ItIsYourData) Twitter bot created by [@White_Fangs](https://twitter.com/White_fangs) that tweets how anyone's data on the internet could be used in a wrong way to raise awareness about data ownership.

It sometimes might tweet absurd stuff also.
