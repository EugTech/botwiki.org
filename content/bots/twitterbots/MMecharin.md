[@MMecharin](https://twitter.com/MMecharin) is a Twitter bot created by [@Kimiko](https://twitter.com/Kimik00). 

It posts random screenshots and short videos from various anime.

From the author:

> [It is still] somewhat experimental. I'm not completely satisfied with the current formula used to adjust weighting of sources. And I'm not completely sure if this is a good theme. Feedback welcome.

>Improved version of [@precure_screens](/bots/twitterbots/precure_screens)'s code. Version 2 sort of. [@precure_screens](/bots/twitterbots/precure_screens) will be switched to the new code when I feel it's done (more or less; can't resist tweaking things here and there ;)
