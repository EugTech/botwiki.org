An interesting online project that consists of a [web page](http://www.laurenhallden.com/lonelyproject/) and a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/aLonelyProject). On the aforementioned page, you can see a random tweet about loneliness. You can choose to either retrieve another tweet or ask the bot to reply to the author of the tweet.

Lonely Project was created by [Lauren Hallden](https://twitter.com/phillylauren), you can watch her talk about it during the [2014 Bot Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CsYtensv94&feature=youtu.be&t=2h27m51s).
