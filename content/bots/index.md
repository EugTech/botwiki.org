> An Internet bot, also known as web robot, WWW robot or simply bot, is a software application that runs automated tasks over the Internet. Typically, bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone.

> Bunch of Twitter usernames that are not controlled by people, but are just robots that are programmed to release the information related to all these different things. **And that's really interesting.**

### &#35;botALLY and Bot Summit

There is a small, loosely connected community of Twitter botmakers exchanging updates under the [*&#35;botALLY*](https://twitter.com/hashtag/botally?f=tweets) hashtag. There is also a dedicated [IRC channel](irc://freenode/botally?key) ([freenode Web IRC link](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=botally)).

The term *&#35;botALLY* was originally coined by [@BooDooPerson](https://twitter.com/BooDooPerson) and is mistakenly believed to be connected to the ["Gamergate Controversy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy) ([source](https://twitter.com/kevinthr/status/635006662273732608)).

[Darius Kazemi](https://twitter.com/tinysubversions) organizes the Bot Summit events dedicated to this community.
