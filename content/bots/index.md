So what exactly is a "bot"? Well, it really depends on who you ask.

> An Internet bot, also known as web robot, WWW robot or simply bot, is a software application that runs automated tasks over the Internet. Typically, bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone.

-- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot)

> Bunch of Twitter usernames that are not controlled by people, but are just robots that are programmed to release the information related to all these different things. **And that's really interesting.**

In essence, an online bot is (usually) a simple program that does something a human would otherwise do, like post pictures on [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) or [retweet](https://twitter.com/) Tweets that talk about cats.

You can pretty much think of bots as programs that turn sites like [damnyoubatman.com](http://damnyoubatman.com/) or [hungernames.com](http://hungernames.com/) into automated [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) or [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) accounts, so you don't have to refresh them. These bots can either wait for a user's input or post their stuff automatically.

Bots can be funny, useful, artistic -- but also annoying and spammy. This site -- and our [botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) community, are dedicated to the friendlier of the online bots.
