So what exactly is a "bot"? Well, it really depends on who you ask.

> An Internet bot, also known as web robot, WWW robot or simply bot, is a software application that runs automated tasks over the Internet. Typically, bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone.

> Bunch of Twitter usernames that are not controlled by people, but are just robots that are programmed to release the information related to all these different things. **And that's really interesting.**

In essence, an online bot is (usually) a simple program that does something a human would otherwise do, like post pictures on Tumblr or retweet Tweets that talk about cats.

Bots can be funny, useful, artistic -- but also annoying and spammy. This site -- and our [botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) community are dedicated to the friendlier of the online bots.
