***This is a fairly new section: [would you like to contribute](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org)?***

Bots for [Slack](https://slack.com/), an online team collaboration tool. Some examples include:

- [slack-poker-bot](slackbots/slack-poker-bot) -- turns Slack into a legitimate Texas Hold'em client
- [@large](slackbots/large) -- on-demand ice cream for your team
- [Oskar](slackbots/oskar) -- tracks how happy people are at work and helps remote teams to prevent isolation
- [shoulda-coulda](slackbots/shoulda-coulda) -- tracks how many times the word "should" is used

There is also a [Slack community](http://dev4slack.xoxco.com/) for Slack developers where also the actual Slack engineers hang out.
