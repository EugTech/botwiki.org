[deadspelunkers](http://deadspelunkers.tumblr.com/) is one of the earliest modern bots, created by [Joel McCoy](https://twitter.com/boodooperson).

> Once every two hours the bot creates and posts an animated GIF of a death from a Spelunky [an action-exploration game] Daily Challenge video uploaded to YouTube, along with a time-stamped link to the source.
