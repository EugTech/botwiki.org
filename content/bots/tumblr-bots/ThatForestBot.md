[ThatForestBot](http://thatforestbot.tumblr.com/) was a Tumblr bot created by [@tinyworlds](https://twitter.com/tinyworlds). It "meant to inspire people to think about nature, by showing them pretty images, gathered from hashtags on [500px](https://500px.com/)".

The bot was disabled after, [according to its author](https://twitter.com/tinyworlds/status/716315292704641025), the images from 500px "shifted in a direction" that didn't fit the bot's aim anymore.
