[cardsync](https://trello.com/cardsync) is an [open source](https://github.com/websitesfortrello/cardsync) Trello bot created by [@fiatjaf](https://twitter.com/fiatjaf). 

It keeps two or more Trello cards in sync across different boards. Whenever descriptions, due dates, attachments, checklists or comments change in one card, the other will be updated to reflect these changes.
