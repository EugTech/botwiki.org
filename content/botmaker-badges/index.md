Using [Mozilla's Open Badges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Open_Badges) project, we are now issuing our own Botmaker Badges! See the list and conditions for applying below.

Once you get your badge, you can add it to your [Mozilla Backpack](https://backpack.openbadges.org/) and show it off, [like this](https://backpack.openbadges.org/share/110353f11a04184be77cd6ae7e856fea/)!

To apply, add your bot to Botwiki using our [submit form](http://botwiki.org/submit-your-bot), and in the description, mention that you're applying for this badge.
