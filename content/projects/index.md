### [¶](#botwiki-org){.pilcrow} Botwiki.org {#botwiki-org}

![Botwiki.org](/content/projects/images/botwiki.png)

[Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) is an open-source collection of tutorials, articles, datasets and other resources for creating useful, interesting, artistic and friendly online bots -- *smart software agents that do fun or useful stuff* -- for Twitter, Slack, IRC and other online networks.

If you'd like to contribute to Botwiki.org, check out [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org). We also have a neat [submit form](https://botwiki.org/submit-your-bot) that lets you suggests bots that you think we should include on the site.


### [¶](#botmakers-org){.pilcrow} Botmakers.org {#botmakers-org}

[![Botmakers.org](/content/projects/images/botmakers.png)](https://botmakers.org/)

[Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) is a friendly Slack group for botmakers and bot enthusiasts. We share ideas, resources, tips -- things that eventually end up on Botwiki.org. We also have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/botwiki/botmakers.org/blob/master/Code%20of%20Conduct.md) -- and it applies to our bots as well!


### [¶](#botzine-org){.pilcrow} Botzine.org {#botzine-org}

[![Botzine.org](/content/projects/images/botzine.png)](http://botzine.org/)

[Botzine.org](https://botzine.org/) is an online newsletter for botmakers and bot enthusiasts, powered by [TinyLetter](http://tinyletter.com/). It goes out every Monday and features *Botmaker Profiles*, a series of interviews that introduce the members of the botmaking community.


### [¶](#botwikibot){.pilcrow} @botwikibot {#botwikibot}

![@botwikibot](/content/projects/images/botwikibot.png)

**@botwikibot** is a multi-network bot, currently working on Twitter and Slack. Here's what it can do:

- on Twitter, it powers the semi-automated [@botwikidotorg](https://twitter.com/botwikidotorg) account
- it retweets tweets from whitelisted accounts (people it follows) that contain the *#botmaker* hashtag
- it retweets tweets shared by DM (also checks if the DM came from an account it follows)
- it watches for keywords on Twitter and posts relevant tweets in a dedicated channel in the [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) Slack group
- if the posted tweet gets a specific reaction (*star*, *heart*, *+1*), the bot retweets it via the [@botwikidotorg](https://twitter.com/botwikidotorg) account
- it can also filter accounts from this search
- the bot handles its responses with [RiveScript](http://www.rivescript.com/)


I'm planning to add more features (polls, advanced functionality for our Twitter tracking channel, and more) and open source the code to make it available to other Slack-based hobby and non-profit groups.

If you'd like to help out with the development, join us at [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/).
