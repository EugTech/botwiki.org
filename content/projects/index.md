The projects we are currently focusing on are:


### [¶](#botwiki-org){.pilcrow} Botwiki.org {#botwiki-org}

[Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/) is an open-source collection of tutorials, articles, datasets and other resources for creating useful, interesting, artistic and friendly online bots -- *smart software agents that do fun or useful stuff* -- for Twitter, Slack, IRC and other online networks.

If you'd like to contribute to Botwiki.org, check out [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org). We also have a neat [submit form](https://botwiki.org/submit-your-bot) that lets you suggests bots that you think we should include on the site.


### [¶](#botmakers-org){.pilcrow} Botmakers.org {#botmakers-org}

[Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) is a friendly Slack group for botmakers and bot enthusiasts. We share ideas, resources, tips -- things that eventually end up on Botwiki.org. We also have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/botwiki/botmakers.org/blob/master/Code%20of%20Conduct.md) -- and it applies to our bots as well!


### [¶](#botzine-org){.pilcrow} Botzine.org {#botzine-org}

[Botzine.org](https://botzine.org/) is an online newsletter for botmakers and bot enthusiasts, powered by [TinyLetter](http://tinyletter.com/). It goes out every Monday and features *Botmaker Profiles*, a series of interviews that introduce the members of the botmaking community.


### [¶](#botwikibot){.pilcrow} @botwikibot {#botwikibot}

**@botwikibot** is a "multi-network" bot that powers the offical [@botwikidotorg](https://twitter.com/botwikidotorg) account (it retweets the core members of the Botwiki team; the source code for this functionality is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/botwiki/community-retweet-bot)) and also helps out in our [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) Slack group where it helps us filter our channel that pulls in relevant tweets.

We are planning to add more features and open source the code to make it available to other Slack-based hobby and non-profit groups.

If you'd like to help out with the development, join us at [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/).
