### [¶](#about){.pilcrow} About the project {#about}


[Corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora) is a "collection of static corpora (plural of [corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus)) that are potentially useful in the creation of weird internet stuff".

The Botwiki team is proud to be hosting the Corpora repository to help creative folks fulfill their text-generating needs.


### [¶](#how-to-use){.pilcrow} How to use {#how-to-use}


The usage is completely free and very simple. [Browse the original repository](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora) and find the corpus you'd like to use, for example:

```
https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/animals/birds_antarctica.json
``` 

Then simply replace

```
https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master
```

with


```
https://botwiki.org/api/corpora
```

Your final URL should then look like this:

```
https://botwiki.org/api/corpora/data/animals/birds_antarctica.json
```
