> TtW is a DIY event run by a small volunteer committee. The event is public, accessible, concerned with social power and inequality, and highlights thoughtful, critical ideas about technology and society. “Theory” doesn’t mean “academic”; we equally value ideas from artists and activists and practitioners and writers and so on. 

One of the panels is titled [Automated Personality](http://theorizingtheweb.tumblr.com/post/141146366985/automated-personality):

> Having a personality is part of what allows us to understand what it is to be human, to be alive. What does it mean, then, to attribute a personality to a bot? What characteristics are used to flesh out a bot’s character, and how does this reproduce the social inequities that are already built in the way so many of these aspects are regarded socially?
