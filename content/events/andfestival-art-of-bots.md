> This weekend of workshops, labs and bot showcases will be a chance to meet pioneers of the bot making community, gain an insight into their practices and also uncover the darker side of these computer programmes. Discover more about bot behaviours and their creative potential and how these are connected to histories in automata and movements such as Dada and Fluxus. It will be a unique opportunity to get hands-on with bot inventions and prototypes as they are being created.

AND was also the sponsor of the [March 2016 Monthly Bot Challenge](/monthly-bot-challenge/2016-march/) and the winner had an opportunity to have their bot showcased.
