> You want to get inspired to build an awesome bot. Maybe you've only begun to learn how to code, or maybe you're neck deep in an advanced project already. Maybe you're a designer or writer who wants to learn great techniques for engaging bot experiences. Maybe you're just curious what this Slack Platform thing is.
>
> Any way you slice it, we'd love for you to join us for an evening of inspiration and guidance as we discuss great bot experiences.
