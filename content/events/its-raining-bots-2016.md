The Online News Association ([ONA](http://ona16.journalists.org/)) hosted a conference in September 2016 and one of the sessions was [about bots](http://ona16.journalists.org/sessions/bots/):

> From Messenger to Slack, bots are suddenly all the rage. They offer a bold new world of distribution that makes Facebook Instant Articles look old-fashioned. Bots can go anywhere, from your kitchen to your car, from your wrist to your phone, and they come with their own personalities. We’ll talk everything from Messenger to Alexa, and discuss the usefulness of bots for keeping people up to speed on what’s happening in the world.
