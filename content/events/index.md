### [¶](#electronic-literature-edx-2015){.pilcrow} [Electronic Literature (Online)](https://www.edx.org/course/electronic-literature-davidsonx-d004x) {#electronic-literature-edx-2015}

Self-paced online course at edx.org, started on October 12 (2015).


> Love letters generated by a computer. An online poem two hundred trillion stanzas long. A mystery novel in the form of a wiki. The story of Inanimate Alice, told through videos and instant messages. An ocean buoy tweeting remixes of Moby Dick. Welcome to the weird world of electronic literature—digitally born poetic, narrative, and aesthetic works read on computers, tablets, and phones. Experimental, evocative, and sometimes simply puzzling, electronic literature challenges our assumptions about reading, writing, authorship, and meaning.
