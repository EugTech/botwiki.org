For our very first [Botmaker Profile](/tag/botmaker), I'm chatting with [Erin McKean](https://twitter.com/emckean), the founder of Wordnik. What is Wordnik?

> Wordnik.com is an online English dictionary and language resource that provides dictionary and thesaurus content, some of it based on print dictionaries such as the Century Dictionary, the American Heritage Dictionary, WordNet, and GCIDE.


-- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordnik). 

Wordnik's API is quite popular with botmakers and powers [several bots](/tag/wordnik). You can support Wordnik by [adopting a word](https://wordnik.com/adoptaword) for a year.

> **Erin:** Hi I’m Erin, I run [Wordnik](https://wordnik.com). I made a couple little Twitter bots (most recently [@infixbot](https://twitter.com/infixbot)) and I always want feedback on how to make the Wordnik API easier to use/show better data.
>
> **Stefan:** So how did you get into making bots?
>
> **Erin:** My first bot was actually made with [Yahoo Pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Pipes). It mashes up the name of a very famous actor with headlines, to make it seem like famous actor is the subject of all news. I rewrote it a few years back to basically be a fork of Darius’ s Two Headlines
>
> **Stefan:** Ah, neat! And what is it like to run Wordnik? Are you the/one of the founders, do you get to work with code?
>
> **Erin:** 1. Fun 2. I’m the founder 3. I do get to code! (see 1)
>
> **Stefan:** That's really cool! What is your favorite project that uses your API?
>
> **Erin:** Probably the site itself.
>
> **Stefan:** Haha, dogfooding, huh?
>
> **Erin:** Totally. But I love seeing new bots using Wordnik.
