Hey there!

This is an example botmaker page, or a *Botmaker Profile*. What are *Botmaker Profiles*? That's a great question, let's do it like this --

> **Stefan:** So what are Botmaker Profiles?

> **Stefan, again:** Well, there was [an idea](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org/issues/20) to make pages for botmakers, perhaps list their bots, maybe mention some other things they did.

> **Stefan, the first one:** Right. But there are some possible issues with that, like, some people don't really like when random websites create "profiles" for them.

I'll just stop the joke here.

I like the idea of approaching people and having a little chat and creating this page with them as sort of an interview. For more notable botmakers, I would probably just ask for some images and links to other interviews they already did. 

How does that sound?
