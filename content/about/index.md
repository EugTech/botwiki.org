Hi!

My name is [Stefan](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish) and I got into botmaking while working on an AI-based online game. I actually wanted to first make a smaller game to get the hang of [RiveScript](http://www.rivescript.com), but I run into mobile browser limitations with no workarounds, so I decided to make [@bartleby_scrvnr](/bots/twitterbots/bartleby_scrvnr) instead. It was kind of fun, so I ended up making a few more [bots](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish/lists/my-twitterbots1/members).

The idea to make [Botwiki.org](https://www.botwiki.org/) came from wanting to be able to run a quick search whenever I get an idea for a bot to see if anyone already made anything similar. The sites that were out there were either [a bit incomplete](http://bothub.org), [hard to browse](http://botdb.gameology.org/bot-list), or plainly just [didn't work](http://botpad.org/p/bot_resources) most of the time.

The main goal of [Botwiki.org](https://www.botwiki.org/) and [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) is to create safe and friendly online spaces for people interested in bots and web APIs -- not necessarily just programmers. Everyone is welcome to [contribute](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org) to [Botwiki.org](https://www.botwiki.org/) and [join our community](https://botmakers.org/) of botmakers and bot enthusiasts. We have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/botwiki/botmakers.org/blob/master/Code%20of%20Conduct.md) and we are also looking for [more core team members](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org/blob/master/HELP-WANTED.md).
