**Botwiki** and all the related projects, including the [Bot! zine](https://botzine.org/) newsletter and [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) Slack group are ([mostly](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org/graphs/contributors)) a labor of love of a single person ([hello!](https://botwiki.org/about/team/#stefan)) and I always appreciate folks reaching out to me offering help

There is a huge backlog of bots and resources I'd like to add to this site, I compile the newsletter, [interview people](/tag/interview), and I organize the [Monthly Bot Challenge](/monthly-bot-challenge/) and seek out sponsors, among other things.

If you don't have the time to help out (which I completely understand!), I'd also appreciate even a small donation, via [Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/botwiki-org/), [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/fourtonfish), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/stefanbohacek) (this is a personal account, please include a note!), or [Bitcoin](bitcoin:15ncoocSHNVsvebH8JQnzeLuHTxzBNDoTa?amount=0.02&label=Botwiki).

Your funds will all go towards covering expenses like **hosting**, **domains**, and I'm also considering hiring someone to help with site updates.

**Thank you!**
