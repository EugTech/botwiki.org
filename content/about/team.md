Hi!

My name is Stefan *[stefn]* and I'm [@stefan](https://botmakers.slack.com/messages/@stefan/details/) on [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) and [@fourtonfish](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish) on Twitter. I am the original creator of **Botwiki.org**, the admin on [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) and I also write the [Bot! zine](https://botzine.org/).

I'm a "full stack" front end developer living in Brooklyn, NY, and officialy a [Mozillian](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/stefan.bohacek/).

You can visit my personal website at [fourtonfish.com](https://fourtonfish.com/) for more links and some of my bigger projects.

**Botwiki** also has [very helpful volunteer contributors](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org/graphs/contributors), including [Hugo](https://twitter.com/hugovk), who [automated our bot submission form](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org/tree/master/submission-form-scripts), [Héctor](https://twitter.com/Zentaurus), who was the first [volunteer translator](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org/blob/master/TRANSLATING-CONTENT.md), and [Kasey](https://twitter.com/bitpixi), who hosts [regular botmaking events in San Francisco, CA](http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Bot-Arts/).

**Huge thanks goes to everyone involved on our projects!**
