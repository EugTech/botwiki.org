Hi!

My name is Stefan *[stefn]* and I'm [@stefan](https://botmakers.slack.com/messages/@stefan/details/) on [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) and [@fourtonfish](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish) on Twitter. I am the original creator of **Botwiki.org**, the admin on [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) and I also wrote the first 32 issues of [Bot! zine](https://botzine.org/).

I'm a "full stack" web developer living in New York, and a [Mozillian](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/stefan.bohacek/).

You can visit my personal website at [fourtonfish.com](https://fourtonfish.com/) for more links and some of my bigger projects.

I'm Veronica!

I'm a podcaster, writer, and bot/AI enthusiast from San Francisco. I love talking and learning about bot projects out there in the world, so tweet them to me [@veronica](https://twitter.com/veronica)!

I'm also an admin at [botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/), maintain the [Bot! zine](https://botzine.org/) newsletter, and sometimes I help [@botwikidotorg](https://twitter.com/botwikidotorg) figure out what to tweet.


<hr/>


 
**Botwiki** also has [very helpful volunteer contributors](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org/graphs/contributors), including [Hugo](https://twitter.com/hugovk), who [automated our bot submission form](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org/tree/master/submission-form-scripts), [Héctor](https://twitter.com/Zentaurus), who was the first [volunteer translator](https://github.com/botwiki/botwiki.org/blob/master/TRANSLATING-CONTENT.md), and [Kasey](https://twitter.com/bitpixi), who hosts [regular botmaking events in San Francisco, CA](http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Bot-Arts/).

**Huge thanks goes to everyone involved on our projects!**
