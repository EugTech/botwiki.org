## What Is OpenShift

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenShift), --

> OpenShift is a platform as a service product from Red Hat.

Great. But what is *platform as a service*?

*[Click.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service)*

> provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage Web applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure

Right. That makes sense. So OpenShift really is just some kind of a web hosting. Cool.

OpenShift is actually a pretty good hosting solution, I used it myself before moving all of my projects to [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). It lets you create three apps for free and unlike [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
