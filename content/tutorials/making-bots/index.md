***Making Bots*** is a tutorial series aimed at people who consider themselves "non-coders" or complete beginners.

There is a variety of tools that make creating bots very easy. From [Cheap Bots Done Quick.com](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) (specifically for Twitter bots) and [Dexter](https://rundexter.com/), which is still in beta, but aims to making creation of bots as easy as [dragging and dropping](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish/status/664130256266264576), to browser-based development environments, like [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) that vastly simplify the development process. You can also find many [opensourced bots](/tag/opensource) that you can reuse and build on top of.

Botmaking has never been easier!
