Hey there, this is Stefan, the creator of **Botwiki.org**.

In this tutorial, I'm going to guide you through the creation of a simple Twitter bot that will randomly select and post a country flag and wait for someone to respond with the correct name of the matching country. 

We are going to use the following tools:

- [Cloud9](https://c9.io/fourtonfish), a browser-based [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), or in other words, a web app where you will write your code,
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/), a way of running [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) on the server,
- and [Twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit), a node.js module (or a library) for interacting with Twitter

***Quick note: You might need to disable your adblocking addon/plugin for the [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) website. At least I had a small problem when the site wouldn't allow me to continue when adding a new project.***

### [¬∂](#step-1){.pilcrow} Creating a Twitter app {#step-1}

The way you make bots on Twitter is that you first create a new account, which is going to be the actual bot, and a Twitter app, through which you will control this bot.

So let's start by [creating a new Twitter account](https://twitter.com/signup). This is relatively straightforward. Now, the tricky part is that if you want your app to be able to post to Twitter, rather than just read from it, you will need to add a phone number to your account. See the [**Note on needing a phone number**](/tutorials/twitterbots#note-phone-number) section of the Twitter bot tutorials page for possible solutions.

After you create your account, go to [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com/) and create a new app. 

![Creating new Twitter app](/content/tutorials/making-what_capital/images/new-twitter-app.png)

The information here won't really show up anywhere that's relevant for us. Once you're done here and land on the next page, switch to the **Keys and Access Tokens** tab. Under **Application Settings**, make sure that it says *Read and write* for your app's **Access level**.

In a moment, we are going to need four things from this page:

- Consumer Key
- Consumer Secret
- Access Token
- Access Token Secret

You need to click the button in the **Your Access Token** section to generate the last two. Done? Perfect, let's keep this page open for now.


### [¬∂](#step-2){.pilcrow} Signing up for Cloud9 {#step-2}

![Cloud9](/content/tutorials/making-what_capital/images/cloud9-logo.png){.float-right}


As explained earlier, Cloud9 is a browser-based IDE, or [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). All this means is just that you can use it to write code, and most of the other things, like setting up your working environment and deploying your app to a server will be taken care of for you.

Cloud9 offers a [free plan](https://c9.io/pricing/public), which offers more than enough for our simple Twitter bot.

So let's [sign up for our free account](https://c9.io/web/sign-up/free). After we fill out all the necessary information, we should land in our Workspaces view. 


### [¬∂](#step-3){.pilcrow} Creating a Cloud9 project {#step-3}

Click [Create a new workspace](https://c9.io/new) and fill out your app's information.

![Creating new Cloud9 app](/content/tutorials/making-what_capital/images/new-cloud9-app.png)

Make sure to select the **Private** option for your workspace, and under **Choose a template**, click **Node.js**. Finally, hit the **Create workspace** button. As a reminder, if the site takes a while to create your project, make sure your adblocker is disabled and try again.

After a few seconds, your IDE should load and you should see something like this:

![IDE](/content/tutorials/making-what_capital/images/ide.png)

I will add links that explain everything in more detail, but for now, I'm just going you quickly run you through the basics so you can get an idea what making bots is all about.

The most important things to know are: you can see your files and folders on the left. `server.js` is where you will write your Twitter bot code. The tab at the bottom where it says "bash" is the *command line*, and we will use that to install the Twit module.


### [¬∂](#step-4){.pilcrow} Installing Twit {#step-4}

We're going to use our command line to install Twit, which, as I mentioned, is a node.js module for interacting with Twitter through their API ([Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface). Simply put, Twit is a sort of a gateway between Twitter and your bot.

Node comes with a very useful tool called **npm** ([What is npm?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)) that lets you easily download modules for your project.

Go to the *bash* tab and type `npm install twit`. This command asks *npm* to *install* a module called *twit*. Yep, it's simple as that.

Now for the fun part!


### [¬∂](#step-5){.pilcrow} Writing code {#step-5}

Right-click into the area with files and folders on the left and click *New file*. Name it `config.js`. This will be your *configuration* file and we'll put your Twitter API keys here. (Note that you can easily right-click the file and click **Rename** if you make a mistake.)

You can think of API keys as, well, *keys* for your bot to access the API, which, again, in turn lets you access data from Twitter and post to it.

```
bot (server.js) -> Twit -> API keys -> Twitter API -> Twitter
```

Copy and paste this into your `config.js` file:

```
var config = {
  consumer_key:         'XXXXX',
  consumer_secret:      'XXXXX',
  access_token:         'XXXXX',
  access_token_secret:  'XXXXX'
}

module.exports = config;
``` 

Remember the Twitter tab we left open? Go back to it and copy the *Consumer Key*, *Consumer Secret*, *Access Token* and *Access Token Secret* and match them up with the code above, for example, replace the `XXXXX` after `consumer_key` with the value for *Consumer Key*, and so on.

If you closed the tab in the meantime, you can go to your [Twitter apps](https://apps.twitter.com/) page, open your app and switch to the **Keys and Access Tokens** tab.


Now, switch to your `server.js` file and delete everything inside it and replace it with the following.


```
var fs = require('fs'),
    path = require('path'),
    Twit = require('twit'),
    config = require(path.join(__dirname, 'config.js'));


var T = new Twit(config);

T.post('statuses/update', {
    status: 'Hello world!'
  },
  function(err, data, response) {
    if (err){
      console.log('Error!');
      console.log(err);
    }
    else{
      console.log(data);
    }
  });
```

Let me explain a few things. `require` is a command in node.js that loads libaries and files. This allows us to load the *Twit* library we installed, but also the configuration file with our API keys. `fs` and `path` are node.js modules that will *help* our script find our files, so that we can, for example, easily load our configuration file.

I will include a link to some JavaScript and node.js tutorials at the end, but for now, the code above can be simplified to something like this:


```
load_module_or_file('twit'),
load_module_or_file('config.js');

make_a_new_object_from(Twit).
using_my_configuration_file(config.js);

use_the_object_to_post_to_twitter(){
  text: 'Hello world!'
}, and_when_you_re_done(){
  if_there_was_an_error(){
    tell_me_what_the_error_was();
  }
  otherwise(){
    tell_me_what_twitter_said_back();
  }
}
```

When you're ready, click the **Run** button at the top of the page.

![First run](/content/tutorials/making-what_capital/images/first-run.png){.centered}

If you followed the tutorial closely, you should see your bot make its first tweet.

![First tweet](/content/tutorials/making-what_capital/images/first-tweet.png){.centered}

If something went wrong, you will see an error message, for example, if you don't copy the API keys correctly, you won't be able to log into Twitter and you will see something like this:

![It's an error!](/content/tutorials/making-what_capital/images/error.png){.centered}


### [¬∂](#step-6){.pilcrow} Adding images {#step-6}

So we decided that our bot will upload a flag of a country and wait until someone responds to our tweet with the name of the capital of the matching country.

I found a pretty good site called [free-country-flags.com](http://www.free-country-flags.com/), which lets you download [over 200 flags, for free](http://www.free-country-flags.com/flag_pack.php?id=1).

In the top menu, click **File**, then **Upload Local Files**. Go back to the *.zip* archive with the flags, extract the files and upload them to Cloud9. Make sure to name the folder ***flags***.


![Flags galore](/content/tutorials/making-what_capital/images/flags.png){.centered}


Using a neat little library called [countries-list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/countries-list), I created a list of about 200 countries and their capitals. [Download the list from here](/content/tutorials/making-what_capital/data/list_of_countries.js) and also upload it to your project.

And [here is my finished `server.js` file](/content/tutorials/making-what_capital/data/server.js). Let me quickly explain the main parts of the code.

We are going to load the list of countries similarly to how we loaded our API keys.

```
var Twit = require('twit'),
    config = require('/home/ubuntu/workspace/config.js'),
    list_of_countries = require('/home/ubuntu/workspace/list_of_countries.js')

var fs = require('fs'),
    path = require('path'),
    Twit = require('twit'),
    list_of_countries = require(path.join(__dirname, 'list_of_countries.js')),
    config = require(path.join(__dirname, 'config.js'));
```

This function will choose a random country from our list. I could go a bit further and keep a list of already used countries to avoid using the same country twice, but this is good enough for our tutorial.

```
function pickRandomCountry() {
  return list_of_countries[Math.floor(Math.random() * list_of_countries.length)];
}
```


To make things simple, we're going to keep a global variable `current_country` which will hold the most recently randomly picked country, and this function will check if the tweeted response matches the answer. 


```
function checkAnswer(answer){
  return (answer.toLowerCase().indexOf(current_country.capital.toLowerCase()) > -1);
}
```


As I explained earlier, the Twit library lets us communicate with Twitter by [using its API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public). Here's an example:

```
T.get('followers/ids',{
    screen_name: 'tolga_tezel'
  }, function (err, data, response) {
  console.log(data);
})
```

Here, we are using the [`GET followers/ids` method](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/followers/ids). So we need to find a method that lets us upload images: [`POST media/upload`](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/post/media/upload). 

Now, this part is a bit more advanced, but essentially works the same way. The `POST media/upload` method requires to pass in the uploaded image as a base64-encoded file. This is really easy to do using the `fs` and `path` modules.

```
current_country = pickRandomCountry();
console.log(current_country);

var imagePath = path.join(__dirname, '/flags/' + current_country.country + '.png'),
    b64content = fs.readFileSync(imagePath, { encoding: 'base64' });

console.log('Uploading flag...');

T.post('media/upload', { media_data: b64content }, function (err, data, response) {
  if (err){
    console.log('ERROR');
    console.log(err);          
  }
  else{
    console.log('Posting the flag...');

    T.post('statuses/update', {
      media_ids: new Array(data.media_id_string)
    },
      function(err, data, response) {
        if (err){
          console.log('Error!');
          console.log(err);
        }
        else{
          console.log('Waiting for someone to answer...');
        }
      }
    );
  }
});
```

Some more ideas to explore:

- you could save the score for each player a [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) spreadsheet (see [google-spreadsheet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-spreadsheet)); then you could post the leaderboard after each game
- you could add more responses to both when the answer is correct and incorrect (using the same technique as for picking a random country)
- you could let the player know if they probably just misspelled the answer (see [levenshtein](https://www.npmjs.com/package/levenshtein), or learn more about Levenshtein distance on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance))

This bot can also be "repurposed" and turned into similar games, for example, you could make a bot that posts outlines of countries and the players need to identify them. You could post images of famous people, landmarks, animals, etc. You could even make the game fully text-based.
