You don't need to be an experienced programmer to join this challenge; making bots is a great way to [learn how to program](https://botwiki.org/tutorials/)! People voting won't see your code, rather they will judge your work based on your creativity and overall execution of your idea.

The theme for this month's challenge is ***PUBLIC DOMAIN***, and the sponsor of this month's Monthly Bot Challenge is [NYPL Labs](https://twitter.com/nypl_labs)!

[NYPL](https://twitter.com/nypl)'s recent [public domain release](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/) makes for a perfect source material for this challenge :-)


> [NYPL Digital Collections](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/) contains hi-res images, metadata, and tools facilitating digital creation and reuse.
>
> The release represents both a simplification and an enhancement of digital access to a trove of unique and rare materials: a removal of administration fees and processes from public domain content, and also improvements to interfaces — popular and technical — to the digital assets themselves.
>
> Online users of the [NYPL Digital Collections](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/) website now find more prominent download links and filters highlighting restriction-free content; while more technically inclined users benefit from updates to the [Library's collections API](http://api.repo.nypl.org/) enabling bulk use and analysis, as well as data exports and utilities posted to [NYPL's GitHub account](http://github.com/nypl-publicdomain/). These changes are intended to facilitate sharing, research and reuse by scholars, artists, educators, technologists, publishers, and Internet users of all kinds. 


Here are the relevant links, again:

- [NYPL Digital Collections landing page](http://publicdomain.nypl.org/)
- [NYPL's GitHub account](http://github.com/nypl-publicdomain/)
- and a link to the [Library's collections API](http://api.repo.nypl.org/)


For your inspiration, here is a [list of Twitter bots](https://twitter.com/nypl_labs/lists/nypl-bot-family/members) that use NYPL's collections API. And here are some other useful resources:

- [Learn more about the public domain on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain)
- [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/feature_films) -- feature films, shorts, silent films and trailers available for viewing and downloading
- [The Digital Comic Museum](http://digitalcomicmuseum.com/) -- public domain Golden Age Comics
- [Public domain images on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/groups/publicdomain/)


The winner will have a choice between an Amazon, Google Play and App Store $25 gift cards.

**Huge thanks to our sponsor -- and good luck to everyone interested in participating!**

Also, be sure to join the [botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) Slack group to share ideas and ask for help.

I'm looking forward to seeing what you'll make :-)
