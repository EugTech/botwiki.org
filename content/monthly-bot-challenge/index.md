You don't need to be an experienced programmer to join this challenge; making bots is a great way to [learn how to program](https://botwiki.org/tutorials/)! People voting won't see your code, rather they will judge your work based on your creativity and overall execution of your idea.

Your goal for the April 2016 Monthly Bot Challenge is to create a bot that **supports a good cause or raises awareness about an important issue**.

You could make a bot that [suggests its followers where to donate money](/bots/twitterbots/donorschamps). Or you could make a bot that [tweets as certain events occur](https://twitter.com/gundeaths).

***Please follow the rules of the network your bot operates on and do not spam users -- only interact with people who [express interest or consent](https://support.twitter.com/articles/76915-automation-rules-and-best-practices).***

The prize and the sponsor will be announced soon!

Be sure to join [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) to share ideas, resources, and find collaboration partners.

I'm looking forward to seeing what you'll make :-)
