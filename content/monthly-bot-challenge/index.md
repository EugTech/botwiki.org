**Botwiki.org** is a site for showcasing friendly, useful, artistic [online bots](/bots/), and our **Monthly Bot Challenge** is a recurring [community](https://botmakers.org/) event dedicated to making these kinds of bots.

### [¶](#rules){.pilcrow} Rules {#rules}

 1. The current theme will be announced **on the first day of each month** via [@botwikidotorg](https://twitter.com/botwikidotorg) on Twitter and in the [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) group.

 2. Everyone will have **until the end of the month** ([Eastern Time](https://www.google.com/search?q=local+time+est)).

 *Note: You can make the bot open source, but it's **not** a condition for entering the challenge.*

 3. You can only submit **one bot**. You can reuse existing code (your own or [open source](/tag/opensource)), but you must add **something new** for the hackathon.

 4. To **enter the challenge**, add your bot to Botwiki.org via the form at [botwiki.org/submit-your-bot](https://botwiki.org/submit-your-bot) and tag it with *monthlybotchallenge*. Be sure to also include an information about yourself being the author.

 *Note that the bot will be submitted to Botwiki, so if you prefer, you can wait until the day before the voting starts.*

 5. You are free to make updates to your bot until the voting starts, even after you submit your bot to Botwiki. Only bug fixes are allowed after the voting period starts.

 6. At the end of the month, we will share a page where people will be able to vote for their favorite bot. The voting will be open **for one week** and the winner will receive the [Monthly Bot Challenge Winner badge](/botmaker-badges/#monthly-bot-challenge-badge) and any [prizes](#prizes) provided by our sponsors.

Not adhering to the rules above **may disqualify you from the contest** (depending on the severity and context, this can apply to the current month, or the Monthly Challenge altogether). Also, while interacting with other participants and members of [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/), you must follow the **Botmakers.org** [Code of Conduct](http://botmakers.org/code-of-conduct/), which also applies to the behavior of your submitted bot.

Naturally, you must also follow the rules of the platform on which you choose to create your bot. (For example, don't make [Twitter bots that automatically reply to people](https://support.twitter.com/articles/76915#replies-mentions).)

If any of the rules are unclear, please [ask questions](mailto:stefan@fourtonfish.com)!

You could make a bot that posts images from NASA's [High Definition Earth-Viewing System](http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/HDEV/) on Twitter. Or you could make a Slack bot that lets you play a trivia [game](/tag/slackbot+game) about space!

You don't need to be an experienced programmer to join our challenge; actually, making bots is a great way to [learn how to program](https://botwiki.org/tutorials/)! People voting won't see your code, rather they will judge your work based on your creativity and overall execution of your idea.

You can browse bots tagged [#space](https://botwiki.org/tag/space) for more inspiration. And definitely be sure to join [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) to share ideas, resources, and find collaboration partners.

We are also going to be listening to ideas and feedback on how to make the Monthly Bot Challenge better.

We're looking forward to seeing what you will make!
