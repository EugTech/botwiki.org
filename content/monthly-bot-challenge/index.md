***Note: The first Monthly Bot Challenge started on November 2, 2015. We are going to use this first challenge to fully flesh out the rules and find the best technical setup, but for now, the rules are going to be very simple:***


On the first Monday of the month, we will announce the topic in our [Bot! zine](http://botzine.org/) newsletter. Everyone will then have three weeks to create a bot inspired by the topic. You can make the bot open source, but it's not a condition for entering the challenge.

Add your bot to Botwiki via the form at [botwiki.org/submit-your-bot](https://botwiki.org/submit-your-bot) and tag it with *monthlybotchallenge*.

After the three weeks, we will send out a form where people will be able to vote for their favorite bot.
The voting will be closed after a week and the winner and a new topic will be announced on the first Monday of the next month.

The topic for the very first Monthly Bot Challenge is:

### SPACE!

If you need some inspiration, have a look at bots tagged [#space](https://botwiki.org/tag/space) on [Botwiki.org](https://botwiki.org/). And definitely be sure to join [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) to share ideas, resources, and find collaboration partners.

We are also going to be listening to ideas and feedback on how to make the Monthly Bot Challenge better.

We're looking forward to seeing what people will make!
