The theme for the February 2016 Monthly Bot Challenge was: ***EMOJI!***

The prize was a choice between a **$20 Amazon *and* Google Play gift card**, courtesy of the [Botwiki sponsors](/about/supporters/), and it was awarded to [Emma Winston](https://twitter.com/deer_ful), the creator of [@thetinygallery](https://botwiki.org/bots/twitterbots/thetinygallery/).
