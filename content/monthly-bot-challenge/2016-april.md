Your goal for the April 2016 Monthly Bot Challenge was to create a bot that **supports a good cause or raises awareness about an important issue**.

You could have made a bot that [suggests its followers where to donate money](/bots/twitterbots/donorschamps). Or you could have made a bot that [tweets as certain events occur](https://twitter.com/gundeaths).
