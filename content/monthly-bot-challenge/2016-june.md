The theme for the June 2016 challenge is: ***image bots!***

To qualify, you must create a bot that primarily uses images: either automatically posts them throughout the day, or responds with images to users, or lets people apply image effects.


Check out the bots tagged with [`#images`](/tag/images) to find more inspiration!

***Sponsor and the prize will be announced soon!***
