# Help wanted!

I really want to see both the [Botwiki.org](https://www.botwiki.org/) website and the [Botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/) commnity grow. We already get helpful contributions from people, but I would really like to have an official **Botmakers.org** team and find more admins/moderators for the **Botmakers.org** community.

With that being said, if you (or anyone you know who might be interested) have any relevant experience with **managing wiki-style websites**, **engaging community members** and **fascilitating interaction**, **managing donations**, **running crowd-sourcing campaigns** or experience in other relevant areas, I'd love to hear from you!

At minimum I'd like to see a proof of **civil** and **engaging** interaction with the general public or another community (your blog, a public Facebook or Twitter page, etc).

I'm [@fourtonfish](https://twitter.com/fourtonfish) on Twitter, **@stefan** in the **Botmakers.org** Slack community -- or you can just send an email to [stefan@fourtonfish.com](mailto:stefan@fourtonfish.com).

Thanks!
